# Raw Branding Themes

## Why do we exist?

Governments provide important services: protecting the vulnerable, enabling industries to function, securing our national interests, providing trusted information, and many other functions. These services used to be provided by people using paper. Government services are becoming increasingly digital - either 100% delivered via software or highly leveraging technology. 

This shift has tremendous potential to create entirely new government services and to improve existing services. Technology allows for rapid speed and scale. Digital services save money, and reduce the burden on taxpayers.

Achieving this digital transformation is the great challenge of governments at this moment in history. Such a shift requires new ways of thinking, new techniques, and new tools. We exist to move that transformation along.

## How do we behave?

### Pride in the Mission

* We support missions we can be proud of to do work we are proud to call ours.
* Government missions deserve the best technology and talent. That makes the government space one of the best places to work.

### Forward-leaning Partners

* We meet clients "where they are" to move forward with digital transformation.
* It takes time and patience to effect change. We will work with any client that is committed to pushing forward, regardless of where they are today.

### Hands-on Builders

* We aren't a strategy-only or architecture-only or advisory-only firm. Our first job is to build digital products. 
* We don't talk in buzzwords. We like to roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty.

### People-focused

* Like soylent green, corporations, governments, and this company are all made of people. 
* We draw strength from diversity. We expand our reach by being inclusive to people of all walks of life. We respect all employees and clients regardless of resume or technical sophistication.
* We seek out the strengths in individuals. Pedigree is for dogs. The potential of a person is far greater than any letters on a resume.
* People have lives. Our work is important, but late nights and weekends are for emergencies not status quo. Work-life balance matters. Employees who have rich personal lives, hobbies, and additional passions come to work fresh and productive.

### Open Environment

* We build open data sharing solutions for government customers.
* We share by engaging with industry and communities.
* We welcome feedback from all directions.
