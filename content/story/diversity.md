 In an effort to be accountable to ourselves and transparent to others, we publish statistics on our own workforce. Our numbers are compared to the tech industry and the general US population as benchmarks.

| | Pluribus | Tech Industry | US Pop. |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Female | 36% | 36% | 51% |
| Minority | 36% | 31% | 42% |


The data is from a survey of 53 employees in June/July 2020. Of Pluribus respondents, 4% chose “Undeclared” for gender and 19% chose “Undeclared” or didn’t answer for Race/Ethnicity.

US population demographics benchmark data comes from the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/IPE120218). Tech industry benchmarks come from the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech) and [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/diversity-in-the-high-tech-industry).
