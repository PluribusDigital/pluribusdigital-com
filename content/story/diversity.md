 In an effort to be accountable to ourselves and transparent to others, we publish statistics on our own workforce. Our numbers are compared to the tech industry and the general US population as benchmarks.

The data is from a survey of 59 employees in September 2022. Of Pluribus respondents, 10% chose “Undeclared” or didn’t answer for Race/Ethnicity.

3% of Pluribus respondents responded "yes" to disability status and veteran status. This is the first year that Pluribus Digital is tracking for disability and veteran status.
