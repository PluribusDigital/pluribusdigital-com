 In an effort to be accountable to ourselves and transparent to others, we publish statistics on our own workforce. Our numbers are compared to the tech industry and the general US population as benchmarks.

| | Pluribus | Tech Industry | US Pop. |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Female | 35% | 33% | 51% |
| Minority | 44% | 31% | 42% |


The data is from a survey of 52 employees in May 2021. Of Pluribus respondents, 2% chose “Undeclared” for gender and 15% chose “Undeclared” or didn’t answer for Race/Ethnicity.

US population demographics benchmark data comes from the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/IPE120218). Tech industry benchmarks come from the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech) and [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/diversity-in-the-high-tech-industry).
