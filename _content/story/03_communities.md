### Industry Communities

Pluribus engages in communities that help the government technology and contracting ecosystem find better ways to serve the government. We are a proud founding member of the Digital Services Coalition, and are a member or participant in other industry communities.

### Technical Communities

We support technical communities as individual employees, and often as a corporate sponsor. We are proud that our employees are leaders and organizers in organizations such as Women Who Code, Northern Virginia Code & Coffee, and Alexandria Code & Coffee.

### Geographic Community

Pluribus supports our greater local community in Arlington and the DC metro area. Involvement includes financial donations and volunteering by employees. We have recently supported the Arlington Community Foundation and Phoenix Bikes.
