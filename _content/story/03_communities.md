### Industry Communities

Pluribus engages in communities that help the government technology and contracting ecosystem find better ways to serve the government. We are a proud founding member of both the [Digital Services Coalition](https://digitalservicescoalition.org/) and [Digital WOSB Alliance](https://www.digitalwosballiance.org/), and are a member or participant in other industry communities.

### Technical Communities

We support technical communities as individual employees, and often as a corporate sponsor. We are proud that our employees are members, leaders, and organizers in organizations such as Women Who Code, Northern Virginia Code & Coffee, and Black Code Collective.

### Geographic Community

Pluribus supports our greater local community in Arlington and the DC metro area. Involvement includes financial donations and volunteering by employees. We have recently supported the Arlington Community Foundation, Byte Back, and Phoenix Bikes.
